<h3><strong>PROJECTS</strong></h3>
<div>
<h4><strong>House Sales Price PredictionCurrent (April 2018 )</strong></h4>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Kaggle.com</h4>
<p>This project focuses on predicting the sales price of the houses in AMES IOWA. There were 79 features across 1500 samples. Summary statistics, exploratory analysis were used to understand the relationship between ���SalesPrice��� and features. I used R programming to explore, visualize and build the models. Cross validation was used to test the model. Linear, Lasso Regression, Random forest and XGBoost models were used. The final model with least Root Mean Square Error was selected. In this case it was XGBoost.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4><strong>Loan Repayment rate for the College students(Oct 2017)</strong></h4>
<p>The goal of this capstone project is to predict the future earnings of the students, a set number of years after they initially enrolled in the college <strong>.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There were 298 features across 17,107 samples. Summary Statistics and exploratory analysis were used for understanding the features and their impact on output variable. Out of these 298 features, 198 were categorical features and 100 numerical features that were evaluated.</li>
<li>Feature selection was done to identify variables that are key for the model. Correlation and Inter correlation was used to filter out numerical features, and Chi-square test was used to identify key categorical features. Final feature set contained 11 independent variables.</li>
<li>Data exploration was done using ggplots (Bar plots, Line plots) and corrplot</li>
<li>Using the R programming language, various models were built (Linear, Random forest, Boosted Random forest). The model parameters were fine-tuned and model with least RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) was selected.</li>
</ul>
